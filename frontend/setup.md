I have a frontend blank project initialized and my final goal is to create a resume classification website one pager.

make HR friendly ui for this website

Here is what ui will contain:
* [-] upload resume button which enables user to select pdf file and shows progress bar on uploading
* [-] upload api /process with only parameter as pdf file method: POST
* [ ] a paginated list of uploaded resumes with filters from api /get-candidates, method: POST
  * [ ] filters include multiselect job roles FullStack and Backend
  * [ ] Seniority level for Junior Sofrware Engineer and Senior Software Engineer
  * [ ] settings to adjust minimum percentage of frontend parameter and backend parameter for both job roles (keep the settings in localstorage)

complete this checklist one point at a time and mark it as done and ask me for feedback
if there is any feedback you can change accordingly and if no feedback and i say continue please continue with next non-completed task.
